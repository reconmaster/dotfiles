## When creating a key, individuals may designate a specific keyserver
## to use to pull their keys from.  The above option will disregard
## this designation and use the pool, which is useful because (1) it
## prevents someone from designating an insecure method for pulling
## their key and (2) if the server designated uses hkps, the refresh
## will fail because the ca-cert will not match, so the keys will
## never be refreshed.
keyserver-options no-honor-keyserver-url

# Don't leak DNS, see
# https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/2846
#keyserver-options no-try-dns-srv

# When searching for a key with --search-keys, include keys that are
# marked on the keyserver as revoked
keyserver-options include-revoked

## when outputting certificates, view user IDs distinctly from keys:
fixed-list-mode

## long keyids are more collision-resistant than short keyids (it's
## trivial to make a key with any desired short keyid)
keyid-format 0xlong

## If you use a graphical environment (and even if you don't) you
## should be using an agent: (similar arguments as
## https://www.debian-administration.org/users/dkg/weblog/64)
use-agent

## You should always know at a glance which User IDs gpg thinks are
## legitimately bound to the keys in your keyring:
verify-options show-uid-validity
list-options show-uid-validity

## include an unambiguous indicator of which key made a signature:
## (see
## http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.mail.notmuch.general/3721/focus=7234)
